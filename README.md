# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This file describes how to repeat the processing and create the tidydata.txt file from the source file available on the web.

1. Copy the "run_analysis.R" script to the desired directory

2. Set the desired to working directory using the setwd() command.

Note: The script downloads the data from the url and unzips it in the working directory and then reads the files into the memory.
